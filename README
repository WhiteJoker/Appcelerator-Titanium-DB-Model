Simple JS Model for Appcelerator Titanium

This is a really simple template for a model to handle database interaction when using
Appcelerator Titanium to build iPhone / Android applications, there are some really 
useful functions, and you can easily add your own custom functions.

We like to place them in their own folder called models i.e.
/Resources/models/item.js


Instructions:
Replace all occurances of Singular with your desired name, i.e. Item, Person, Setting etc
Replace all occurendes of TABLE with the name of your table, i.e. ITEMS, PEOPLE, SETTINGS
Replace all occurences of DB with the name of your DB
Enter all your columns in the this.columns array, created and updated will be automatically
updated so you just need to include them in your table


Usage:
TO INCLUDE THE MODEL
Ti.include('models/item.js');

TO CREATE A NEW ENTRY
var item = new Item();
item.name = 'Example';
item.price = '2.99';
item.save();

TO UPDATE AN ENTRY
var item = new Item();
item.getById(1);
item.name = 'Example 2';
item.save();

TO GET NUMBER OF ROWS
var item = new Item();
var numRows = item.countAll();

TO LOOP THROUGH RESULTS
var item = new Item();
var rows = item.getAll();
for ( var i=0, len=rows.length; i<len; ++i ){
   Ti.API.info('ID: ' + rows[i].id);
   Ti.API.info('Name: ' + rows[i].name);
}
